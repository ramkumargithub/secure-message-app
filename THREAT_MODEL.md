**Overview**
This document outlines the threat model for the Secure Messaging App MVP built using Node.js and TypeScript. It is based on the STRIDE methodology and focuses on identifying, mitigating, and managing security threats relevant to a RESTful internal messaging platform.

System Description
The app provides the following API endpoints:

POST /app/users/register: Register a user.

GET /app/users: List users with availability status.

POST /app/messages/users/{user_name}: Send a message.

GET /app/messages/users/{user_name}: Retrieve received messages.

**Technology Stack**
Node.js + TypeScript

Express.js framework

Docker (with optional docker-compose)

Environment config via .env

CI pipeline: Bandit, Trivy, CodeQL

JWT or token-based authentication (assumed)

**STRIDE Threat Analysis**
Threat Type	Description	Affected Areas	Mitigations
Spoofing	Impersonation of users or services	Login/Register endpoint, Message sending	- Require strong authentication (e.g., JWT)
- Validate and sanitize input
- Use HTTPS
Tampering	Malicious data modification in transit or at rest	Messages, User data	- Use TLS/HTTPS for transport
- Store hashes where applicable
- Input validation and integrity checks
Repudiation	Users denying actions	Messaging activity	- Log user activity securely
- Use signed tokens
- Include timestamps and sender ID
Information Disclosure	Exposure of sensitive data	Message content, User availability	- Limit data exposure (e.g., no full user profile)
- Encrypt sensitive fields (at rest and in transit)
- Role-based access control
Denial of Service (DoS)	Service disruption via traffic or abuse	All endpoints	- Rate limiting and throttling
- Input size checks
- Monitoring and alerts
Elevation of Privilege	Gaining unauthorized access rights	Admin-only or message endpoints	- Enforce role-based access controls
- Token scope validation
- No hardcoded credentials

**Key Assets**
User identities and credentials

Messages and metadata (timestamp, sender)

**Availability status**

Access tokens or session information

Trust Boundaries
Client ↔ Server: Protected by HTTPS

Server ↔ Database: Trusted internal connection (Docker bridge or cloud VPC)

CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub workflows with security scanners

**Assumptions**
The database uses access controls to restrict read/write operations.

The app will run behind a reverse proxy or API gateway in production.

Environment variables are securely managed and not exposed in code.

Open Issues / Future Enhancements
Add MFA for sensitive actions.

Implement message expiration or deletion policies.

Consider using end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for message content.

Set CSP and HTTP security headers.
